###  Real time chatting app

**Note:** 
This **fullstack web app** was made to be responsive on major screen sizes including both desktop and mobile! Main focus wasn't having prettiest app ever but responsive one for all sizes!
This app was made by me as portfolio piece. Task was to replicate real time chatting app, of whom I picked
telegram. Goal of the whole project was to eventually have a good portoflio piece app that allows real time chatting using firebase and react. Main focus 
for me was to bring reusage of code and prop drilling to bare minimum, and try to build app and code structure as if it was for real world usage, by which I mean get the app to have best speed possible.
Lowered usage of tailwind to minimum in prototyping faze so I could lose less time and skip to scss when i get main logic up. 

 # Goals:

### Portfolio goals:

   * Build full stack real world application with React;
   * Have real time chatting with minimum delay possible;
